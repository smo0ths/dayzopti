**Open file with:**
Windows key + R: %USERPROFILE%/Documents/DayZ/SPC.DayZProfile

**Edit correspondingly:**

refresh=144; (Your monitor's refresh rate, -1 defaults to your actual refresh rate now)

GPU_MaxFramesAhead=1; (test 2 3 4 yourself, lowest is said to have less input lag)
mouseSmoothing=0;

FSAA=0; (set to 1 if you want to use AtoC, AtoC makes the game look smoother)

shadowZDistance=50; (Shadows off but if on will help)

HDRPrecision=8; (16 = Better for night time)

anisoFilter=0; (Better visual acuity at cost of sharper looking textures)


**FOV:** if 70 (default) otherwise all numbers fluctuate according to the settings below


**Objects setting in game (sceneComplexity):**

sceneComplexity=100000; (Set before launching game) (can be lower) (see enemy up to 500m)

**Normal** = 500000; (Without zooming see enemy up to around 800m) (recommended)

Holding right click (zooming) adds around 300m on each setting.


**View distance:**

viewDistance=2000; (Lower this to match other settings or gain fps)

preferredObjectViewDistance=1300; (Lower this to match other settings or gain fps)
